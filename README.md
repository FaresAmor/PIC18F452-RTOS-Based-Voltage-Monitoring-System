This project demonstrates a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)-based voltage monitoring system using the PIC18F452 microcontroller. The system includes three primary tasks: toggling an LED for system "heartbeat" indication, periodically measuring an analog voltage via the ADC, and transmitting the measured voltage over an RS232 interface. The ADC data is sampled from an analog input, converted to millivolts, and displayed in a readable format through serial communication, providing an efficient solution for real-time voltage monitoring and debugging in embedded systems.
